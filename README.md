# Enyo-Animated: animated Controls for the Enyo framework

These Controls are designed to
* help the user mentally model the application UI
* not make the user wait
* animate at 60 fps on modern mobile devices
* be easy for developers to incorporate in apps
* work with Onyx, Mochi or Moonstone widgets (the default styling is usually Onyx).

They are not designed to be showy.  Fallbacks for older browsers have not yet been added.

They are designed around the properties that GPUs can readily animate:
* position: transform: translate(x,y)
* scale: transform: scale(n)
* rotation: transform: rotate(n)
* opacity: opacity: 0..1

## Using

1. Clone this repo to a directory in the lib directory of an Enyo app (beside layout).
2. To source/package.js, add the line `"$lib/enyo-animated",`
3. Add one or more of the controls to your app.


## animated.ToastBottomSlide

A straightforward toast, which moves like a CD tray.
It is centered and by default it's as wide as the screen and tall enough to contain its children.
Set a width or height in the style property.  Default styling is white text on a dark background.


## animated.ToastBottomLeftCurve

A corner toast, which moves as if mounted on a mechanical linkage, actuated by servo motors.
By default, it's sized to contain its children.
Set a width or height in its style property.    Default styling is white text on a dark background.


## Unwritten widgets

Feel free to implement and contribute these.

### Expand-from-control-popup

This Control would expand from a visible control, and contract back into it, like a Menu and its button.
